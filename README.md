# SE-assignment2

##  Project Overview
This repository contains my work for the Git and GitHub assignment for the Software Engineering course.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate understanding of repository setup, branching, pull requests, and conflict resolution.

##  Installation Instructions
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Damola0204/SE-assignment2.git
   cd SE-assignment2

2. Ensure Python is installed on your computer.
You can verify this by running:
   ```bash
   python --version

4. Run the sample program:
   ```bash
   python hello.py

##  Usage Example

After running hello.py, you should see the following output:
   ```bash
   Hello, World! From main and feature-2 resolved

##  Branching and Collaboration

main branch: stable version of the code

feature-1: implemented greeting feature

feature-2: used for simulating and resolving a merge conflict

Pull requests were created and merged to demonstrate GitHub collaboration features.

##  Issues and Documentation

Two issues were created to track project tasks:

Add detailed project documentation (assigned to Damola)
